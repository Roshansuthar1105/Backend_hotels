this is for our local system only
        1. git init to initiate a reposatiory
        2. git status to show to status of files
        3. put names of files in .gitignore file to untrack/avoid upload
        4. git add . to upload all the files except the files in .gitignore
        5. git add <file> to upload a single file 
        6. git rm-r --cached <name> to remove files from git reposatiory not from local folder
        7. to save snapshot of our project : git commit -m 'comment'
        m = modified
        8. to make an another version of our project first we have to run the command git add . or <file>
            then the git commit command
To link the local and remote reposatiory we have to upload the code to github
    1. git remote add origin git@github.com:<userName>/<reponame>.git
    2. git branch -M main
    3. git push -u origin main
