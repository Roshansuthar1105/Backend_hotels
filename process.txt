File system and operating system in node js

import 
const fs = require('fs')
const os = require('os')
var _ = require('lodash')

we can also import other files like this 

const var1 = require('file path');
and we have to export something
like this
    module.exports = {
        va1,
        v2,
        v3,
        .
        .
        .
    }


eg
{
demo.js :=>

    in main file 
var demo = require('./demo');
console.log(demo.add(1,2),demo.a,demo.sum)
}
